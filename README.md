# SQL-_COVID-Death-2020-2024


# COVID Deaths SQL Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 death data from the years 2020 to 2024 using SQL queries. By querying relevant databases and datasets, this analysis aims to gain insights into the trends, patterns, and demographics of COVID-19-related deaths over the specified period.

## Features
- SQL queries to extract and analyze COVID-19 death data.
- Aggregation of data by various factors such as time (e.g., monthly, yearly), location (e.g., country, region), age group, gender, etc.
- Calculation of key metrics such as total deaths, death rates, mortality rates, etc.
- Visualization of insights using SQL-based reporting tools or integration with external visualization platforms.

## Requirements
- SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server)
- Access to COVID-19 death datasets for the years 2020 to 2024
- SQL client or interface for executing queries
- Optional: Visualization tool (e.g., Tableau, PowerBI) for graphical representation of insights
